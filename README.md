# UW-Madison Themed Quarto Website Template

This is a bare-bones University of Wisconsin-Madison themed template for Quarto websites. This template generally follows the [visual identity guidelines](https://brand.wisc.edu/) provided by UW-Madison.

### Customizing the Template

Most elements of the template can be customize using the `custom.scss` [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) files. Other visual elements that are created in R, such as ggplot2 graphics, can be customized within code chunks or by using common variables and themes set in `setup.R` and sourced as needed.

The `image` directory contains basic graphics, such as the UW shield and a favicon, for use with the template. These can be easily replaced with other logos, such as department or office logos.
