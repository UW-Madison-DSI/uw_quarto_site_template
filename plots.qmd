Static plots can be easily customized by creating a theme. The theme `scatter_theme` is defined for a simple scatter plot in `setup.R`, which is then sourced and applied to the example plot below. Colors variables can also be defined in `setup.R` and then passed to ggplot arguments to customize plot elements.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
source('setup.R')

iris |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point(color = point_color) +
  ggtitle('An Example Plot') +
  scatter_theme
```

Interactive plots generated with Plotly will generally follow predefined themes but will not preserve custom fonts.
