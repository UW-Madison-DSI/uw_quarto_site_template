```{r}
source('setup.R')
```

Code chunks are set, by default in `_quarto.yml`, not to echo or print messages or warnings. These settings can be changed in that file.

An example R code chunk, with echoing enabled, is below:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

Quarto also supports code chunks in some other languages, such as Python and Julia, with the installation of the `reticulate` package in R.

```{python, echo=TRUE}
import numpy as np

a = np.array([['Go', 'Bucky'], ['Beat', 'Minnesota']])

a.shape
```
