## R

```{r}
source('setup.R')
```

Code chunks are set, by default in `_quarto.yml`, not to echo or print messages or warnings. These settings can be changed in that file.

An example R code chunk, with echoing enabled, is below:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

## Other Languages

Quarto also [supports other languages](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/#what-programming-languages-are-supported-in-quarto), such as Python (via the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package) and Julia (via the [`JuliaCall`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/index.html) package). Requires installation of these languages.

Python:
```{python, echo = TRUE}
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(a)
```

Julia:

```{julia, echo = TRUE}
using Plots

plot(sin, 
     x->sin(2x), 
     0, 
     2Ï€, 
     leg=false, 
     fill=(0,:lavender))
```
